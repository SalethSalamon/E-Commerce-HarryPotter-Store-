                                wonderfully</h5>
                            <p className="mb-1">While it may not be as flashy, refined, or impressive as the rest of the
                                films in the franchise, Sorcerers Stone or Philosophers Stone for the Potter purists
                                deserves immense credit for setting up this series so wonderfully, and laying a
                                fantastic foundation off of which the other films could be built. Director Chris
                                Columbus was not only responsible for putting together the incredible cast, but he also
                                captured Rowlings wizarding world on film in a manner that felt relatable and wholly
                                transfixing. Sorcerers Stone is told through the eyes of an 11-year-old, and so the
                                film was always going to skew a bit younger than subsequent installments, but Columbus
                                refuses to talk down to his audience and wisely sidesteps delving into cartoony kids
                                movie land.
                                <br/> <br/> And even though its tonally the lightest film of the bunch, Sorcerers Stone
                                still works wonderfully as a fantastic entry in the Potter franchise. The winning
                                combination of charm and smarts permeates throughout, and Columbus nails the founding
                                friendship of our three heroes, culminating in a grand finale that lets each one of them
                                shine. Who can resist adorable Ron Weasley commanding a giant chess set with gusto as he
                                sits atop a stone knight?

                                Harry Potter Franchise is certainly one it's best
                            </h5>
                            <p className="mb-1">
                                The first and the most crucial movie in the Harry Potter Franchise is certainly one
                                it's best- it happened to be my first exposure to the world of Harry Potter and the
                                lifelong obsession that was about to follow.
                                <br/>
                                The first shot of Hogwarts- immediately mesmerizing with it's tall towers and windows
                                glimmering with candle-light as the bewitching soundtrack by John Williams plays- is a
                                testament to how well the film is made. Minor details like the gorgeous mountains and
                                lakes that surround Hogwarts lurk in the background or at the edges of the frames and
                                make the whole thing dreamier, and magical. It's all so enchanting that one doesn't
                                nitpick the special effects which while being perfectly good for that time, seem a bit
                                funny today.
                                <br/>
                                The credit for this certainly goes to JK Rowling more than any one person because it's
                                such a well realised world- it's the details of her imagination, after all, that the
                                movie brings on the screen. The story is- as we know- one of the most interesting ones
                                ever told in our lifetimes.
                                <br/>
                                The casting certainly helps- the actors have been chosen less to accurately portray the
                                physical features of their respective characters than to innately exude particular
                                energies- Alan Rickman as Snape looks evil before he utters a word; Emma Watson as
                                Hermoine looks honest and sincere; McGonagall looks like the phenomenal character that
                                she is- and at the center of it all is Daniel Radcliffe- who makes the part his own- no
                                one else could have been Harry Potter in a million years.

                                I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books
                                that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first
                                movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first
                                notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was
                                transported to another world. John Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a
                                personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other
                                composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's
                                something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the
                                "magical" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.

                                This movie is really good. I know it is based off the book but I'm just going to focus
                                on the movie version. Despite some of the child-acting being a bit over the top, it
                                doesn't really matter because they're only kids and play their characters perfectly. The
                                casting for other characters is perfect. Even though this movie does drag out a bit, it
                                is still really good. The villain, Voldemort, is one of the best villains of all time
                                and his accomplice in this movie no spoilers is also really entertaining.
                                Worth the watch and if your a fan of the books/coming to the Harry Potter series for the
                                first time, then I think you will probably enjoy it.
